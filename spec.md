Implement the feature specification based on the updated constitution. I want to build an Instagram MockUp WEbApp that social media researchers can use to experimentally test the effect of showing media content (images, videos) in a realistic Instagram-like reel feed. The Feed should mimicke Instagrams look and feel as closely as possible.
- At this point, user management is minimal (just registering, sign in and log out)
- project management is layers: projects - Feeds (experiments) - media overview
- Projects have the folling settings: name, query string key (to identify a specific participant) time limit (after which the feec closes), redirect url (where participants are redirected to when feed closes), end screen message (shown before redirect), lock all positions toggle (show media in feed in order they are listed, if false, randomize order), randomization seed for reproduceability. Then two actions: delete project and save changes
- Feeds have the following settings: Feed name, Persist timer across reloads (When enabled, the timer continues from where it left off if a participant refreshes the page. If time has expired, they will be redirected immediately.), Show unmute prompt (When enabled, a pulsing highlight appears around the mute button to prompt participants to enable audio.) Then delete feed and save changes
- Medias (feed elements) can be added via the "add media" button. Here users can either drop a media file form local or input an Instagram URL which is then fetched and used to populate the dialoge (media file, account information, engagement information).
- Users can preview the feed from the media overview and copy a link to the feed that is then shared among experiment participants. The media overview shows all media in a tabluar form (Author account), lock (whether to lock position in feed in case of randomized positions), thumbnail of media, caption, metrics (likes, comments, reshares). Then users can also edit individual media items from the overview (the same options like when adding media), display an indivial media item to preview how it will look like in the eventual feed, pre-seed comments via an LLM that reads the media caption and the media file and generates Instagram like captions; and delete a media item
- the feed shows each media item in the same order for each participant (randomized unless items are locked in a given slot). Videos should autoplay once viewed. At the bottom there is a "progressbar" moves in accordance with the length of the video.
- Generally, all information that is appended to a link (query strings) must also be appended to the redirect link so they can be captured by the redirect host.
